# CS-330

Hey all, in my project I wanted to create something that was within my ability but not so within it that I wouldn't learn anything from do in.
This proved to be a little bit challenging because as it turns out I did already know a good amount of the basics when it comes to graphics. This is probably due to my background as a gamer. Unfortunately, my artistic skills aren't up to the task but hey, we're talking about the programming aspect which I'm perfectly capable of doing. I don't really have any questions about it as this course ends, but Iâ€™m still super impressed with how much math these parts are doing behind the scenes. I guess it always boils down to just math but still it never ceases to amaze.

 I wanted to recreate a couch and coffee table, but as usual the hardest part of working with graphics is finding textures to use. I saw other peers also mention this, and usually the solution is to literally just create your own. That was out of my wheelhouse, so I just opted to use the included textures from the assignments instead. I also might've made the light source a bit too orange as well as having trouble aligning the boxes for the couches.
